# KeyboardRemap
My custom keyboard remap, in two versions:

 1) the main version uses a combination of [Capsicain](https://github.com/cajhin/capsicain) and [AutoHotkey v1](https://www.autohotkey.com/), which is more reliable
 2) the old version is AutoHotkey-only; it is  not maintained, but currently still mostly up-to-date with the main version

## Notable features

- **Browser mode:** separate "browser mode" config that allows me to operate a browser using one hand by mapping letters to browser navigation keys - f=ArrowDown, d=ArrowUp, e=PgUp, s=PgDown, w=ArrowLeft, r=ArrowRight, t=Ctrl-Shift-Tab,...

- **CapsLock for special characters:** separate layer that lets me type all commonly used special chars using the middle 3 keyboard rows - CapsLock-d=`(`, CapsLock-j=`'`,

 - **`Shift-<num>` for Czech accents** (and `Ctrl-Shift-<num>` for uppercase)
 - **`;` and `L\` as a layer for navigation** (I don't understand why people with ISO layout keyboards )
